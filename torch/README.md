Instructions
------------

To build this, you need the following parts:

* Painted, printed parts from this project
* Some 20 gauge solid core wire
* LED tea light
* Wire snips
* Soldering Iron
* Hot glue gun
* Hot glue stick
* Superglue

Print the following parts (the others were used to build these):

* stone_torch_wall_hatch.stl
* stone_torch_wall.stl
* torch_battery_holder.stl
* torch_lower_base.stl
* torch.stl

First, take apart the LED tea light.  I used one from "Room Essentials".  Take out the screw and pry apart the housing.  Once that is apart, set aside the LED and the battery.  You can throw away the rest.  First assembly step is to take the battery and put it in the battery holder in the base.  The positive side should be down, with the negative side facing up.  The switch on the battery holder should be placed so that itgoes through the bottom hole in the base.

Test fit your LED in the torch.  You will want the longer lead (the cathode) such that when you fit the torch in the wall, it's on the side of the wall that leads to the long thin groove.  This will be where wire goes to touch the negative side of the battery.

Clip some lengths of wire.  the wire I had was insulated, so I had to use a wire stripper to get the insulation off.  Then, test fit it in the wall.  Make sure one wire runs down the thin groove so it will contact the battery.  Add a loop to the end of the other wire to make it easier for the battery to touch it.

Once the wiring is in place, fit in the torch, and hold things by hand so that all the metal touches properly.  Flip the switch and test to see if your torch flickers to life.

When you know the torch works when in place, it's now time to glue it all togeher.  I put in a drop of superglue between the torch and the LED to hold it into place.  Next I take a  hot glue gut and squirt some hot glue over the LED.  I then use the hot glue gun to shape the form of the fire on the torch.

Trim the wires into place.

Test again before you solder.

Solder your LED's leads to the wires and test again.

Pull the top and bottom apart., make sure that the fit is good.

Glue with superglue (yes, this means the battery is not easy to access, but these last a pretty long time, and superglue is easy to pry apart if you really need to.)

Finally, glue the hatch piece into place.
